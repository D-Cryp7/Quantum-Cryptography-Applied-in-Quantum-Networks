# Quantum Cryptography applied in Quantum Networks
Design of a Quantum Network with Quantum Key Distribution protocols

_by Daniel Espinoza (D-Cryp7) & Nicol√°s Jara_

## Implementations
### BB84
#### Simple BB84
BB84 Protocol for Quantum Key Distribution in a 2-node Quantum Network . It creates a single Quantum Channel (unidirectional) and two Classsical Channels (bidirectional) with the respective Callback Functions.

### Ekert
#### Basic Entanglement
Generation of entanglement between 2 qubits using Quantum Gates for the Ekert Protocol. Next, the idea is to create a Quantum Network with that QKD Protocol.

#### 3-node Entanglement Swapping
Implementation of Ekert Protocol in a 3-node Quantum Network using Quantum Repeater for the Entanglement Swapping. The resulting qubits for Alice and Bob are evaluated through a fidelity function, verifying that both qubits are entangled. After that we can create the shared key and encrypt messages with classical cryptography.
